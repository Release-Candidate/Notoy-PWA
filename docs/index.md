Some words on the 'why':

## Why?

This is mainly a project to try PureScript and less a 'serious' attempt at a note app, so the PureScript specific things shown in this app are:

- Mainly writing a progressive web app in PureScript (not the service worker, this is more or less an autogenerated list of files to cache)
- Using Halogen
- Using a PureScript PWA as a share target
- Sharing text from a PureScript PWA
- Using the geolocation API
- Doing reverse geolocation using a web API (using `BigData`'s geolocation services)
- Wrapping callbacks in an `Aff` (`getCurrentPosition` geolocation function)
- Doing JavaScript FFI
